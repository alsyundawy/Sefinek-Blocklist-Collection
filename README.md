## 📦 How to Acquire the Blocklist
- The first option is to [generate your own list](https://sefinek.net/blocklist-generator), recommended for users who want to customize the list based on their specific needs and preferences.
- The second option is to use the [default list](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/tree/main/docs/lists/md) provided, ideal for those who prefer a quick, straightforward solution without customization.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> I do not allow commercial use of my lists. Lists I did not create are shared under the licensing terms set by their original authors.
> If you wish to use the Sefinek Blocklist Collection for commercial purposes, please contact me via email.
> Do not download the lists every hour either. Click [here](https://blocklist.sefinek.net/update-schedule) to learn more.

## ❌ How to Report a False Positive? ([more info](https://blocklist.sefinek.net/false-positives))
False positives can be reported by creating a new [Issue](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/issues), submitting a [new PR](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/pulls) (just remember to follow the required syntax, see [whitelists/main.txt](https://github.com/sefinek/Sefinek-Blocklist-Collection/blob/main/whitelists/main.txt#L10)), on our [Discord](https://sefinek.net) server, or by contacting me via [email](https://sefinek.net/contact-me).  
Within 96 hours, I will add the domain to the [whitelist](whitelists/main.txt). Shortly after, the false positive will be automatically removed from the blocklist by [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/update-blocklists.yml).
